# Blockchain_IoT_HHZ
This repository is a collection of work done by students at the Herman Hollerith Center (HHZ) in Germany (http://www.hhz.de).

With this project, the students aimed to make the private car selling market more secure and transparent by implementing a Blockchain enviroment which saves the mileage status of cars, so that everyone knows once he / she is buying the car if the given mileage status is valid.

If you are interestested in this project, please feel free to use our wiki and keep on progressing our idea - we are looking forward seeing your idea within this Github repository
